            "   As New Zealander of the Year I'm calling on every one of my fellow Kiwis to help support a very important cause. Racism needs your help to survive. You may not be in a position to give much to racism but whatever you feel comfortable giving will make a huge difference. You don't have to be a full on racist just being a tiny bit racist is enough. A smile, a cheeky giggle, even a simple nod in agreement it all adds up, and it gives others the message that it's okay. Frequently Asked Questions about Racism Of course! Even if you don't come from a racist background, that's okay. Being a bit racist is super easy. You don't actually have to talk people into it just be a bit racist and they'll feel the social pressure to follow along. Shut up mum! Ah, nothing. There's no benefit whatsoever to being racist. But ask yourself, what if everyone stopped giving to racism? What kind of future would that be for our children? Not to you, no. But to the people receiving the racism they'll be getting hundreds of small bits every day so it will add up. It will be noticed. You might not want to wear a t-shirt that says how much of a racist you are. No thanks, I'm racist on the inside. But you can laugh at racist comments. It does the same thing. (laughs) Remember, the only thing that can keep racism alive and help it grow, is feeding it. Nurturing it. And that's where you come in. Will you help it flourish? What will you give to racism? \n",

[Payton] When I see the protest I feel kind of like a sense of joy and I believe that the protesters are doing something great. And that it's good that they're upset about what's going on. Because if they weren't upset then nothing would ever change and we'd all, it would just be a cycle repeating itself over and over again. [Nancy] I was proud of the people that decided to take a chance and stand up for what they believe is right. And I respect the people that are in the protest making their voice be heard. [Josiah] It made me happy to see a lot of people uniting throughout the world of different colour. Showing their support of all lives matter and Black lives matter too. [Payton] When people see me I want them to know that I'm Black and I'm here and I'm proud to be Black. And there's nothing wrong with me for being Black. I want them to know that just because I'm Black doesn't make me a criminal. And doesn't mean I have intentions towards anybody just because of the colour of their skin. [Nancy] I want people to know that I am kind and I can be a friend. And that I don't pose any threat to them. [Josiah] I want people to know that I'm a strong Black man. I am not scary or anything. I don't steal. I don't do anything bad. And stop judging me when you see me. [Payton] Just because you like a Black Lives Matter post doesn't mean you're part of the cause. It means that you like the post. There's other things that you can do that be much more helpful to fix the cause. And well change the system all together. [Nancy] I feel like I don't have a voice. Well mostly because of my age and who I am like who I am as a person. But I know if I do try to do something, I could make a difference within my neighborhood. [Josiah] People like us. People of colour. They don't really get the same chances as my other friends. They don't really get the same options. And it makes conversations harder for people that can't really understand what you're going through. If people see my skin colour and assume stuff about me. Just make judgments right away I can't really change their mind. [Adrienne Arsenault] A reminder that Kids Help Phone is always there to help.

HERE TO REACT FORMER PROFESSOR DR. CAROL SWAIN. DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING THE PROGRAM. WE HAVE HEARD THESE THEORIES BEFORE THAT BLACK KIDS, BROWN KIDS IN COMMUNITIES THEY CAN’T LEARN.

REJECT IDEAS OF NATURAL GIFTS AND TALENTS EQUITABLE FROWNS ON HAVING ONLY ONE RIGHT ANSWER. SO, IF YOU DON’T SAY THERE IS ONE RIGHT ANSWER, THEN YOU ARE RACIST. THIS IS NOT FOR PREPARING OUR KIDS.

ARE THEY BEHIND THIS EDUCATION? >> WELL, WE KNOW THAT THE TEACHERS UNIONS ARE BEHIND IT, BUT THE PROGRESSIVES, DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING CRITICAL RACE THEORY ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT WILL DESTROY OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND MORE AFFLUENT PARENTS CAN TAKE THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOLS. THEY CAN PUT THEM IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY ARE BEING TAUGHT OR CHARTER SCHOOLS OR THEY CAN HOME SCHOOL BUT THEIR CHILDREN WHO ARE TRAPPED IN INNER CITY SCHOOLS THOSE ARE THE ONES WHOSE LIVES ARE BEING DESTROYED. EVERY AMERICAN NEEDS TO STAND UP AND FIGHT AGAINST THIS DANGEROUS CRITICAL RACE THEORY AGENDA. IT’S A WORLD VIEW. IT’S DESTRUCTIVE. IT NEEDS TO END NOW. LAWRENCE: THEY WANT TO DEFUND SOMETHING.

            "It probably wouldn't be a normal day in my life in Berlin  if someone didn't cross the street when I walked by  or got up from the train when I sat down. All the time but I just write them off as they're not worth my time. Growing up in Germany as a brown kid wasn't easy. And it often was very alienating.  Being four years old and not understanding on the street  why people are shouting stuff at you you, you and your parents are not understanding, but really feeling that something’s wrong,  you know that you're not welcome. A P.E. teacher who sexually harassed me and other young girls when we were 10 and 11 years old.  When I went to the headmaster to speak out about the way this man touches us and the fact that we feel very uncomfortable about it,  I was told that in this country this is how P.E. is taught. And up until this point I had thought that  I was German and I thought of myself as German. Most of the times when I’m going up or down Metro stations, I see white people holding their bags. I was walking on the streets of Wittenau with my housemate, he's Syrian and a guy chased us and yelled at us why we are so brown. Mainly people shout stuff like we are in Germany and we speak German here if you don’t like it, go back home. He was saying like foreigners they come here and they don't know how to ride transportation properly and their feet are too far,  I should walk over there just cut both of their feet off. On my first date in Germany, she told me she pushed herself to have more boyfriends of colour because her grandfather was a Nazi. Twenty-four years of being black you know racism more than anyone else.  After a while you're not you're not going crazy, you're not just being wildly negative, it's real it's happening. The most frustrating thing is having to let it go out of fear of not being treated properly  by perhaps the police or being harmed.  These things keep on repeating themselves and they continuously make me feel as if  I'm not at home in this country. You feel like you lost a bit of your integrity if you didn't really stand up for yourself  the way you think you should have.  So it's always a mixture of emotions,  but always sadness that the way you look causes your day to be negative. \n",

Hi everyone. So, there is a huge\\nmovement going on. People, millions of people\\nacross the world are standing up to fight\\nagainst racism. And they\\'re doing this\\nbecause too often, and for such a long time, people have been\\ntreated unfairly. And in some cases,\\neven hurt by others because of the colour\\nof their skin. This stuff isn\\'t easy\\nto talk about, which is exactly why we have\\nto talk about it. It\\'s a tough conversation,\\nbut I\\'m glad we\\'re having it. People might think\\nthat my life looks fine, but the truth is, I and\\nso many other black people have to deal with racism. All the time. It\\'s really hurtful, and\\nit can be scary and sad, and I wanted to share some\\nstories about that today. Barbie and I had a sticker\\nselling contest on the beach last month. We split up and went\\ndifferent directions to see who could\\nsell the most. Well, while I was\\non the boardwalk, beach security stopped me\\nthree times. What? They asked me all these\\nquestions over and over, and they even called my mom. [gasps] I never told you, but that\\'s why I sold\\na few stickers that day. The security officers thought\\nI was doing something bad, even though I was doing\\nexactly what you were doing. And remember when\\nwe were going to join that French honour club\\nat school? Mm-hmm. Well, I made a perfect score\\non the entrance test. But when the teacher,\\nwho didn\\'t know me at all, gave me my results, he told me that I only did well\\nbecause I \"got lucky.\" He said he knew I couldn\\'t speak\\nFrench that well. What? You speak French\\nbetter than all of us. Why didn\\'t you just stay in\\nthe club and prove him wrong? I don\\'t want have to constantly\\nprove and re-prove myself. He supported you right\\nfrom the beginning, and didn\\'t support me. Usually when I talk\\nabout these things, people make excuses. They say things like “oh, well maybe you should\\'ve\\nhad a permit \"for selling on the beach.\" But those are just excuses. People did these things to me\\nbecause I was black and they made the wrong\\nassumptions about me. And they don\\'t make\\nthose assumptions about white people like me. That\\'s not fair, because\\nthat means that white people get an advantage\\nthat they didn\\'t earn, and black people get\\na disadvantage that they don\\'t deserve. Exactly. It\\'s really serious. Some people even get hurt\\nwhen others think the wrong things about them. That\\'s exactly why people\\nare marching. Because when enough of us\\nstand together, people pay attention. Right. Because when we don\\'t\\nsay anything, we\\'re just letting it continue. Well, you listening\\nand being supportive, that\\'s helpful. It\\'s important to keep\\nreading and learning more about black history. And if someone is being\\ntreated unfairly, stand up for that person. If we all work together,\\nwe can make a big difference. Thank you so much for sharing\\nall of this with me today. With us. Yeah. It\\'s not easy,\\nbut it\\'s necessary. ']\n",

Those are significant,\\nbut most racial damage is done through less visible actions, often through policies and norms in our organizations and communities. Some say we should be\\ncolorblind and ignore race but that would mean ignoring the biases that are inherent in our systems, the rules and routines\\nthat perpetuate inequity. Anti-racism calls for explicitly\\ntaking race into account in order to disrupt,\\nracialized hierarchies for the sake of promoting social justice and respect for human dignity. How can we work toward anti-racism? First, remember that racial justice is a journey not a destination. Understand that others might\\nbe at a different point in their growth and keep in mind that we all have blind spots. Engage in difficult conversations. Many of us are uncomfortable\\ntalking about race. We're concerned, we might\\nsay something wrong. We need to acknowledge the\\ndiscomfort and lean into it. Examine best practices\\nand existing resources. What have others done that\\ncan provide guidance for you? We must disrupt existing\\npolicies and practices. It can't just be add\\nfolks of color and stir, it's more than compositional diversity, it's about challenging our assumptions about every aspect of how\\nour organization functions. How do we recruit employees? Who is in the room when\\ndecisions are being made? How are people evaluated and promoted? Do we rely on informal social\\nnetworks for key decisions? At the University of\\nDayton, being anti-racist means examining all of those questions as well as evaluating our curriculum, looking at the setup of our social spaces, strengthening efforts to improve diversity and equity among faculty,\\nstaff and students, ensuring we have mentoring\\nand support mechanisms in place and more. The responsibility for\\naction should not fall on certain departments or on the underrepresented population. It must be the responsibility of all of us across the organization. Remember that it's a journey, and our work will never be finished.  It's important to create a feedback loop so that we can continuously reassess as we make progress toward\\nbecoming anti-racist. \"]\n",

For more ...', 'VitalSmarts Video', \"We’ve all been there. You’re in a workplace setting and someone says something flatly racist. You cringe inside because you\\nknow you should say something. Then you try to manufacture\\nall kinds of excuses in your mind to avoid the conflict. “Oh, he didn’t mean it that way,” or, “best not to confront\\nit in the moment,” or, “I’ll talk to him later,” or, “this isn’t my job, it's HR’s,” or, “someone else will deal with it.” Part of the problem is that in the moment you’re filled with a confusing combination of disgust and fear. You hate what you just heard and feel revulsion toward\\nthe person who said it. At the same time, you’re scared to make an enemy\\nor provoke a confrontation. So what can you do? Speak up, but not in\\nthe way we typically do. Don’t start with your\\njudgments or feelings. Start with facts. Facts are uncontroversial. People are less likely to take offense if you simply playback what just happened. Start like this, “I want to talk about\\nsomething that just happened. While we were talking\\nabout the launch team, you said, ‘we can’t include Omar, people like him don’t\\nrelate well in the South.’ Did I hear that correctly?” Be careful to repeat it\\nwithout exaggeration. Don’t add volume or\\nemotion that wasn’t there when it was said. Once you’ve confirmed what\\nwas said, get curious. Ask for a fuller explanation\\nof the intent if needed, then share your views or\\nfeelings on the issue. Bias in the workplace won’t change until we change how it is discussed. When you need to confront\\nsomething touchy, remember, facts first, feelings second. \"]\n",

The playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMs_JcuNozJb-5TJ3uuvqPzQVjO_XarED If you have ...', 'vlogbrothers', 'Good morning Hank, it\\'s Tuesday. I want to talk about racism today, but I\\'m\\nalready pretty nervous, because, one, I am definitely not an expert and, two, racism\\nis big and complex and nuanced and the Internet -- god bless it -- doesn\\'t really specialize\\nin nuance. But a bunch of recent surveys have shown that\\nabout 75% of white Americans do not think that there is racial bias in the criminal\\njustice system, and a slight majority of white Americans don\\'t think that racism is a significant\\nproblem in America. But so far as I can tell, Hank, whether systemic\\nbias against African-Americans exists in the United States is not really a debatable point,\\nso I want to look today at some data. OK, let\\'s begin with the criminal justice\\nsystem. So last year, the US Sentencing Commission\\nreleased a report showing that African American men\\'s prison sentences were, on average, 20%\\nlonger than white men\\'s prison\\'s sentences when they were convicted of similar crimes. And in fact, in the past decade, the racial\\ngap in sentencing has been widening. Also, black people and white people use illegal\\ndrugs at almost identical rates, but black people are three times more likely to be arrested\\nfor drug possession. Also, African Americans are far more likely\\nto be stopped and searched by police, at least in the jurisdictions that keep good records,\\neven though, in many cases, the contraband hit rate -- the chance that an officer will\\nfind something actually illegal -- is higher among white people. By the way, there\\'s links about all this stuff\\nin the dooblydoo. But there\\'s just so much, Hank, I mean, people\\nconvicted of crimes and then later exonerated by DNA evidence are disproportionately black. Black kids are more likely to be tried as\\nadults than white kids and more likely to be sentenced to life in prison, and even after\\nrelease, black former inmates are less likely to get callbacks from potential employers\\nthan white former inmates, regardless of the crime committed. Speaking of which, let\\'s turn to the job market. So one of the things that makes it so hard\\nto isolate race when trying to study it is that so many other factors are at work in\\nsystemic injustice, right? Like, there\\'s class and health and wealth,\\nnone of which are fully separable from race. But -- OK, so a large 2004 University of Chicago\\nstudy submitted thousands of resumes to a huge variety of employers, and all the resumes\\nwere completely identical -- except for the applicant\\'s name. It could be Emily or Brendan or Lakisha or\\nJamal, and Lakisha and Jamal got 50% fewer callbacks than Emily and Brendan, despite\\nhaving literally identical resumes. Hank, I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s about race. In fact, studies consistently show racial\\nbias in employment and hiring in the US, and also around the world, but I only have four\\nminutes, so links in the dooblydoo! In education, again, the evidence of systemic\\nbias is pretty overwhelming. For instance, among American high schools\\nwith mostly black and Latino students, only 74% offer Algebra II as a class; just 66%\\noffer chemistry... the percentages for mostly white schools are much higher. When it comes to healthcare, you could write\\na book about racial bias, and in fact, people have, but I\\'ll just quote from an American\\nCollege of Physicians report from 2010: \"Overwhelming evidence shows that racial and\\nethnic minorities are prone to poorer-quality healthcare than white Americans, even when\\nfactors such as insurance status are controlled.\" And as the reports point out, by some measures,\\nincluding life expectancy, which is really the ultimate measure, the disparity has been\\nincreasing for decades. Now, Hank, I want to be clear that most of\\nthis research establishes correlations, which isn\\'t the same thing as causation. Like, certainly the tremendous economic inequality\\nright now in the United States is a factor in racial disparities. But then of course, race also factors into\\nclass and economic status. Like, for instance, much of the racial wealth\\ndisparity in the US is due to inheritance: white people are far more likely to inherit\\nmoney and land than black people are, and that\\'s due in large part to the fact that\\nfor almost all of American history, it was basically impossible for African Americans\\nto accrue wealth. Now, Hank, I\\'m obviously just scratching the\\nsurface here, but to deny the existence of systemic racism is to deny a huge body of\\nevidence indicating that racial bias affects almost every facet of American life. Hank, the last thing I want to say is that,\\nwhile I think statistics and data are really important, I also think it\\'s important to\\nlisten to the voices of the people who have been affected by racism. Data is cold in a way that humans are not,\\nand to really understand these statistics, and their impact on the real lives of real\\npeople, we need to find ways to listen to those people. Hank, I\\'ve put together a playlist and some\\nlinks in the dooblydoo as a start. Hank, I\\'ll see you on Friday. ']\n",

You often write and speak about how they are\\nintimately connected. And talk about a world that you envision. Yeah, racism is integrally linked to capitalism. And I think it’s a mistake to assume that\\nwe can combat racism by leaving capitalism in place. As Cedric Robinson pointed out in his book\\nBlack Marxism, capitalism is racial capitalism. And, of course, to just say for a moment,\\nthat Marx pointed out that what he called primitive accumulation, capital doesn’t\\njust appear from nowhere. The original capital was provided by the labor\\nof slaves. The Industrial Revolution, which pivoted around\\nthe production of capital, was enabled by slave labor in the U.S. So, I am convinced that the ultimate eradication\\nof racism is going to require us to move toward a more socialist organization of our economies,\\nof our other institutions. I think we have a long way to go before we\\ncan begin to talk about an economic system that is not based on exploitation and on the\\nsuper-exploitation of Black people, Latinx people and other racialized populations. But I do think that we now have the conceptual\\nmeans to engage in discussions, popular discussions, about capitalism. Occupy gave us new language. The notion of the prison-industrial complex\\nrequires us to understand the globalization of capitalism. Anti-capitalist consciousness helps us to\\nunderstand the predicament of immigrants, who are barred from the U.S. by the wall that\\nhas been created by the current occupant. These conditions have been created by global\\ncapitalism. And I think this is a period during which\\nwe need to begin that process of popular education, which will allow people to understand the\\ninterconnections of racism, heteropatriarchy, capitalism.

(roaring) Over the course of 85 years, his story has been told\\nin eight different films, and countless adaptations. Released in 1933, the\\noriginal film, King Kong, was a smash hit that spawned\\nan immediate follow-up. The film was known for its\\nthrilling action sequences and never-before-seen special effects. The series then continued with two Japanese-made installments, a 1976 reboot with 1986 sequel, and finally, Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the original film. Kong returns in 2017\\nin Kong: Skull Island, a reimagining of the original story. Historically, King Kong's character has been rooted in a\\nracially-charged narrative. To understand how, it's\\nimportant to look closely at the storyline. Here's a refresher. A group of men, accompanied\\nby a beautiful woman, travel to an uncharted\\nisland inhabited by savages who worship a giant ape named Kong. The men capture Kong and\\ndisplay him in New York City as the eighth wonder of the world. Driven by love, Kong escapes,\\ntakes the beautiful woman, and climbs a tower, only to\\nbe shot down by war planes. You know, your classic\\nBeauty and the Beast tale. - Oh no, it wasn't the airplane. It was beauty killed the beast. (record scratching) - [Narrator] Not really. Creator, Merian C. Cooper, crafted a story that illustrated black\\nhysteria and xenophobia. Cooper denied this, claiming\\nhe never intended to do so, but the racial parallels exist. Take another look. This time with key identifiers. A group of white men, accompanied by the\\nquintessential white woman, travel to an uncharted island inhabited by native savages, who worship a giant\\nblack beast named Kong. The men capture the beast\\nand bring him to America in chains. - We'll give him more than chains. He's always been king of his world, but we'll teach him fear. - [Narrator] Sound familiar? Not long after, the\\nbeast escapes his captors and steals the woman. She is saved by heroic white men who kill the black beast and reunite her with her intended mate. Whether Cooper intended to or not, Kong can be interpreted as an allegory for the American slave trade and interracial relationships. In the latest remake, Kong: Skull Island, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts insists his reboot will\\ndistance itself from early films while still maintaining the\\nessence of the Kong story.

My reaction to George Floyd's death was -- It was a mix between anger and sadness that things that go on today that should have ended a long time ago still happen. [Payton] When I see the protest I feel kind of like a sense of joy and I believe that the protesters are doing something great. And that it's good that they're upset about what's going on.

What does the Bible say about ...', 'Got Questions Ministries', 'Today’s question is, “What does the Bible\\nsay about racism?” In this video I’ll answer that question\\nfrom a biblical perspective. Then afterwards, as always, I’ll share some\\nhelpful resources, so stick around until the end. The first thing to understand in this discussion\\nis that there is only one race—the human race. Caucasians, Africans, Asians, Indians, Arabs,\\nand Jews are not different races. Rather, they are different ethnicities of\\nthe human race. All human beings have the same physical characteristics\\n(with minor variations, of course). More importantly, all human beings are equally\\ncreated in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27). God loved the world so much that He sent Jesus\\nto lay down His life for us (John 3:16). The “world” obviously includes all ethnic\\ngroups. God does not show partiality or favoritism\\n(Acts 10:34), and neither should we. James 2:4 describes those who discriminate\\nas “judges with evil thoughts.” Instead, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves\\n(James 2:8). In the Old Testament, God divided humanity\\ninto two “racial” groups: Jews and Gentiles. God’s intent was for the Jews to be a kingdom\\nof priests, ministering to the Gentile nations. Instead, for the most part, the Jews became\\nproud of their status and despised the Gentiles. Jesus Christ put an end to this, destroying\\nthe dividing wall of hostility (Ephesians 2:14). All forms of racism, prejudice, and discrimination\\nare affronts to the work of Christ on the cross. Jesus commands us to love one another as He\\nloves us (John 13:34). If God is impartial and loves us with impartiality,\\nthen we need to love others with that same high standard. Jesus teaches in Matthew 25 that whatever\\nwe do to the least of His brothers, we do to Him. If we treat a person with contempt, we are\\nmistreating a person created in God’s image; we are hurting somebody whom God loves and\\nfor whom Jesus died. Racism, in varying forms and to various degrees,\\nhas been a plague on humanity for thousands of years. Brothers and sisters of all ethnicities, this\\nshould not be. Victims of racism, prejudice, and discrimination\\nneed to forgive. Ephesians 4:32 declares, “Be kind and compassionate\\nto one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” Racists may not deserve your forgiveness,\\nbut we deserved God’s forgiveness far less. Those who practice racism, prejudice, and\\ndiscrimination need to repent. “Present yourselves to God as being alive\\nfrom the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God” (Romans 6:13). May Galatians 3:28 be completely realized,\\n“There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one\\nin Christ Jesus.” Want to learn more?

Being four years old and not understanding on the street  why people are shouting stuff at you you, you and your parents are not understanding, but really feeling that something’s wrong,  you know that you're not welcome. A P.E. teacher who sexually harassed me and other young girls when we were 10 and 11 years old.  When I went to the headmaster to speak out about the way this man touches us and the fact that we feel very uncomfortable about it,  I was told that in this country this is how P.E. is taught. And up until this point I had thought that  I was German and I thought of myself as German. Most of the times when I’m going up or down Metro stations, I see white people holding their bags. I was walking on the streets of Wittenau with my housemate, he's Syrian and a guy chased us and yelled at us why we are so brown. Mainly people shout stuff like we are in Germany and we speak German here if you don’t like it, go back home. He was saying like foreigners they come here and they don't know how to ride transportation properly and their feet are too far,  I should walk over there just cut both of their feet off. On my first date in Germany, she told me she pushed herself to have more boyfriends of colour because her grandfather was a Nazi. Twenty-four years of being black you know racism more than anyone else.  After a while you're not you're not going crazy, you're not just being wildly negative, it's real it's happening. The most frustrating thing is having to let it go out of fear of not being treated properly  by perhaps the police or being harmed.

But also in normalized\\npolicies and practices that lead to inequitable\\noutcomes for people based on racial identity. It's the combination\\nof historical decisions and normalized practices that lead to unequal access to housing and to high quality schools. The impact of systemic racism means that as an African-American male, I'm more likely to go\\nto jail and less likely to get a job I'm qualified for. Sometimes these\\ninequalities are not driven by a desire to discriminate, but by unconscious biases that people have developed\\nover their lifetime. Systemic racism even normalizes the way we think about the\\ncolors black and white. For instance, we're taught to\\nassociate white with beauty, purity, and the good guys. Black on the other hand, is more often than not associated with the bad guy. It's evil and scary. In and beyond our churches, Jesus is persistently presented as White, even though that is\\nhistorically inaccurate. Conversely, the black sheep family member is the ostracized one. The white lie is in some\\nway more acceptable. These seemingly innocent associations are habitually conveying the value of white versus black. In small ways and big\\nways, the cumulative effects of systemic racism give people\\ndifferent access to opportunities. This can have an intergenerational impact. For example, between 1983 and 2013, White households saw their\\nwealth increased by 14%. However, during the same period, Black household wealth declined by 75%. Median LatinX household\\nwealth declined 50%. The disproportionate impact\\nof the COVID pandemic on Black, LatinX, and indigenous people is a direct outcome of systemic racism. To disrupt and dismantle systemic racism in our communities, in\\nour nation, in our world, we need to first understand\\nits origins and how it has operated over time, and the profound and violent\\nimpact it continues to have in the lives of people. Here at the University of Dayton, we are committed to anti-racism as an essential component\\nof being a university for the common good. (inspiring classical music) \"]\n",

After screenshots of the group messages made\\ntheir way around the Internet, Blinks rallied together to get the hashtag #RespectLisa trending,\\nas well as demanding respect for her and her hometown.\\xa0 Many fans tweeted out messages toward Lisa\\nand how much she means to them, like one user who wrote, “ALL BLINKS STAND BY YOU LISA. WE WILL PROTECT YOU. WE RESPECT YOU A LOT. YOU DESERVE TO BE LOVED. WE LOVE YOU LISA FOREVER.” Another Blink issued this PSA saying QUOTE,\\n“You have no right to hate/criticize/discriminate people for where they come from, the color\\nof their skin, their preferences, what they do in their private lives if they don't hurt\\nanyone, etc.”\\u2028 And this fan tweeted, “A hardworking, inspiring\\nbub deserves only good things in the world! #RespectLisa. WE LOVE YOU LISA!”\\u2028 As many fans know, unfortunately this isn’t\\nthe first time Lisa has been scrutinized and publicly shamed by trolls… back in January\\nof 2019 at the 33rd Golden Disc Awards, a slew of Internet trolls attacked her appearance\\nafter Blackpink stepped onto the red carpet. According to K-pop news outlet Koreaboo, commenters\\nwere taking aim at her look and what she was wearing. But it’s not just Lisa who is constantly\\nharassed by online trolls… just last month, her bandmate Jisoo endured a similar situation\\nafter she was cyberbullied for not being as fluent in English as the rest of the group.\\xa0 #RespectJisoo went viral as supportive Blinks\\ncame for xenophobic haters, explaining that Jisoo is literally South Korean, her native\\nlanguage is not English and that Blackpink’s music is sang mostly in Korean. One thing that makes Blinks so strong and\\nunited is the fact that Blackpink has brought together fans from all different countries,\\ncultures and traditions, and no matter what they choose to sing, or how they choose to\\nsing it, these girls just strive to do what they love for the fans they adore!

Let’s get into it. Earlier this month, tragedy struck Atlanta,\\nGeorgia when a domestic terrorist was arrested for shooting up three different spas around\\nthe city, which tragically left eight people dead. This was just one instance of violence against\\nAsians that have increased over the past year. Huffington Post reports that the violence\\nappears to be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, which Donald Trump routinely referred to as\\nQUOTE \"the Chinese virus.\" “Some important developments in our war\\non the Chinese virus.” And a study from California State University\\'s\\nCenter for the Study of Hate & Extremism found that hate crimes against Asian Americans increased\\n149 percent in 2020. Now, the men of BTS are speaking out and sharing\\ntheir own devastating stories of facing racism as the violence against Asians has increased. In a new statement, which was shared in both\\nKorean and English, the members of BTS recalled \"moments when they faced discrimination as\\nAsians.\" The boys of BTS put out a shared statement\\nthat read quote, “We have endured expletives without reason and were mocked for the way\\nwe look. We were even asked why Asians spoke in English. We cannot put into words the pain of becoming\\nthe subject of hatred and violence for such a reason.” The BTS boys continued on saying, “Our own\\nexperiences are inconsequential compared to the events that have occurred over the past\\nfew weeks. But these experiences were enough to make\\nus feel powerless and chip away our self-esteem.\" And they added that “What is happening right\\nnow cannot be dissociated from their identity as Asians.” BTS said that they’ve spent time discussing\\nhow they want to voice their message and they concluded their post saying, “What our voice\\nmust convey is clear. We stand against racial discrimination. We condemn violence. You, I, and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together.” And we couldn’t agree more with BTS. We thank them for sharing their stories, we\\nstand with them and the entire Asian community, and we condemn any act of violence. Fans also flooded the comments of BTS’ post\\nto show their support and thank them for sharing their experiences. One person wrote quote, “Thank you for using\\nyour platform & using your voice to raise awareness. I\\'m sorry for all the things you had to face. We\\'ll continue to stand strong and fight against\\nracial discrimination. We love you! Thank you so much for taking the time to make\\nthis post.” Another fan chimed in saying, “We knew the\\npain you’ve felt but you all kept it away from all of us. Perhaps to make us feel more comfortable. We stand with you and for you always. Love you all.” This person added “thank you so much for\\nsharing your stories, and for always making us feel less alone. we are always by your side, standing, and\\nwe love you more than anything. thank you.” And this fan said quote, “Thank you for\\nopening up about your experiences despite them being traumatic and using your voice. Hate & discrimination is still hate & discrimination\\non both a small scale, and big scale. We all have the right to be respected. We stand together.” Our hearts and our deepest condolences go\\nout to the families, friends, and millions of people who have been affected by these\\ndevastating acts of violence. And we’re thankful that celebrities like\\nBTS have used their platform and their voices to discuss this serious issue. If you or anyone you know is wondering how\\nto get involved and support the AAPI community, down in the description, we’ve listed ways\\nto donate, volunteer, educate yourself, and report incidents of Asian hate.

Sussan Mourad @sussan_mourad #BillieEilish #MatthewTylerVorce #LostCause.', 'Clevver News', \"Billie Eilish has issued a public apology\\nafter a past video surfaced online last week of her using an anti-Asian slur, and now,\\nshe’s owning up to her past mistakes. Let’s get into it.\\xa0 Just last week, Billie Eilish fans were left\\nin shock after a video compilation resurfaced on TikTok of her using racist slurs and mocking\\nthe Asian culture and language as a teen.\\xa0 The video quickly made its way around the\\nInternet as many waited for Billie to respond to the controversial footage, and finally,\\nin a lengthy statement via Instagram stories, she is issuing a public apology for her past\\nactions. But before we get into the story, I just wanted\\nto issue a trigger warning as we will be covering sensitive topics that include racism, so please\\nonly continue watching if you feel comfortable doing so.\\xa0 And for all purposes of sensitivity, especially\\nfollowing all the recent Asian hate crimes occurring throughout the U.S., we won’t\\nbe showing the video compilation, but rather focusing on the bigger issue at hand, which\\nis Billie now taking accountability.\\xa0 Billie took to Instagram on Monday to share\\nthis message to fans, starting out by letting her 87 million followers know that after the\\nvideo made its way around the Internet, she’s now “being labeled as something that [she’s]\\nnot. She said, “There's a video edit going around\\nof me when I was 13 or 14 where I mouthed a word from a song that at the time I didn't\\nknow was a derogatory term used against members of the Asian community. I am appalled and embarrassed and want to\\nbarf that I ever mouthed along to that word.” Billie went on to apologize, saying that “regardless\\nof the ignorance and age at the time, nothing excuses the fact that it was hurtful,” and\\nQUOTE, “for that I am sorry.” Another part of the video features what many\\nbelieved to be Billie mocking the Asian language while speaking in an accent, to which she\\nclaimed it was simply “gibberish” and a made-up language she used in the past while\\ntalking to her pets, friends and family. She ended her statement by understanding that\\nregardless of how it was interpreted, there are people she deeply hurt, and for that,\\nencouraged fans to continue to have difficult and uncomfortable conversations in order to\\nlearn.\\xa0 Billie finished by saying, “I not only believe\\nin, but have always worked hard to use my platform to fight for inclusion, kindness,\\ntolerance, equity and equality. We all need to continue having conversations,\\nlistening and learning. I hear you and I love you.” Many fans were relieved that Billie had finally\\naddressed the situation, however, this didn’t stop others from wondering why she hadn’t\\nsaid anything about her rumored boyfriend Matthew Tyler Vorce, and the controversy surrounding\\nhis racist social media posts that also resurfaced.\\xa0 Last Thursday, he also took to his Instagram\\nstories to issue an apology for using homophobic and racial slurs in the past, as well as allegedly\\ncalling Adele the ‘British Miss Piggy’ back in 2012. He wrote, “I am ashamed and deeply sorry\\nthat I used them in any context. It is not how I was raised and it is not what\\nI stand for. I shouldn’t have used this language in the\\nfirst place and I won’t use it again. I am so sorry for the hurt I have caused.” While we do NOT condone this type of harmful\\nbehavior under any circumstance, Billie does make a point in that continuing to take accountability\\nand have these difficult conversations is only the first step of a long way to go in\\nfighting for inclusion, acceptance and tolerance. We can only hope she and Matthew have both\\nlearned a great deal from this and will continue to grow and do better in the future.\\xa0 To see what Billie also had to say to fans\\nwho are convinced they know about her personal life, click right over here for a full rundown.\\xa0\\xa0 Then be sure to let me know all your thoughts\\non Billie’s response to the resurfaced video right down here in the comments. I’m your host Sussan Mourad, I’ll catch\\nyou later, bye guys. \"]\n",

And these racial issues impact people more than just on a social level... as Laci ...', 'Seeker', 'Things that can make you sick: allergens, contaminated food and water, and\\nracism! Hey folks, welcome to Dnews. Laci Green here. My favorite commercials are those ones that\\nare like, \"Did you know that stress is terrible for your health?\" Yea! Stress can lead to high blood pressure, and\\nsupressed immune system, and diabetes. And then you\\'re like, \"Oh great! Now I get to be stressed out about being stressed\\nout.\" Man! Stress is like a bad cycle. And it\\'s a cycle that affects some folks more\\nthan others. A new study published in the Journal of Sociological\\nInquiry found that after analyzing data from 30,000 people, racial minorites had significatly\\nhigher rates of stress. And it\\'s symbolic of a great divide between\\nthe health of the dominant race versus the minority race in countries around the world. It\\'s well documented that minority groups\\nin the U.S. have way more stress, poor mental health and poor physical health than white\\nAmericans. Racial minorities get sick more, their illness\\ngets more severe, it happens at younger ages, and they die sooner than white people do. In the U.S., New Zealand, and Canada, the\\naverage lifespan of male minorities is seven years shorter than the white male average\\nin the country. In Australia, it\\'s twenty one years shorter. So the big question here is, \"Why?\" It\\'s a tricky puzzle, peeps, with lotsa pieces,\\nmore than a short YouTube video could ever hope to place. But there are a few key factors here: racial\\ndiscrimination, class, and education level. A study at the University of Western Australia\\nfound that aboriginal participants were five times as likely to report negative treatment\\nbased on their race and twice as likely to have health problems. The American Journal of Public Health found\\nthat even anticipating racism, which minorities commonly experience with racial profiling\\npolicies like \"Stop and Frisk,\" is enough to trigger a harmful stress response. The British Medical Journal published a study\\nfinding that those who initially screened a negative for all mental illnesses, were\\ntwice as likely to have detereorating mental health when they experience racial discrimination. So these are some of the reasons why scientists\\nare calling for racial prejudices, from interpersonal type, like being suspicious of someone because\\nthey\\'re black, to systemic types, like providing a little funding for schools in the \"ghetto,\"\\ncan be addressed not only as a social justice issue, but a public health issue. At a conference in Switzerland last week focused\\non addressing racial health disparities, researchers laid out what they think can be done about\\nthis. The first, is to recognize that there\\'s something\\nthat\\'s not quite right here. Second is to say, \"Nu uh! Inequality is not cool!\" And lastly, to make real changes that will\\nbetter the health of minority groups. So, next stop, end global poverty! Thanks for joining me friends. Don\\'t forget to subscribe to Dnews for two\\nnew science updates every single day! Yea, that\\'s how much we love you. I\\'ll see you next time. ']\n",
